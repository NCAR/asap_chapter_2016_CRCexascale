\section{Benchmarking Results}\label{sec:bench}

  We next provide an analysis of the impact that our efforts have had on preparing for exascale computing.  For the analysis of the spectral element dynamical core we utilize two platforms, Yellowstone a Haswell based Infiniband Linux cluster installed at the NCAR Wyoming Supercomputing Center (NWSC), and Carl a Knights Landing based test platform deployed at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center (NERSC).  We also provide timing information for several kernels on a 4-socket Haswell based system at NCAR in the HPC Futures Laboratory.  The specific configuration of each platform is provide in Table \ref{tbl:platforms}.  On these platforms we have used the Intel 17.0.0.042 compiler suite, and the Intel 5.1.3.210 MPI libraries.  We used the compiler flag "-O3 -fp-model fast -qno-opt-dynamic-align" for all runs along with the correct architecture flag.
